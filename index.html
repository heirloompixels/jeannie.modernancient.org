            <h2>Handwoven treasures for lovers of life.</h2>

            <p>Weaving has become central to my life as an artist. 6 + years ago while living in India, I became enamored, entranced and obsessed with textiles, two years later when I returned to the US, i bought a loom off of Craigslist.....and the rest is history.</p>

            <p>After 6 years of living on the road (the last bit with the loom in the camper), we decided to plant some roots in New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment for good reason. I now fill my days weaving, sewing, dyeing, dreaming, working in the garden, marveling at the flowers, cooking good food and when ever there is a spare moment, playing in the mountains that surround our home.</p>

            <p>I create from a deep inspiration, and I hope that my creations also inspire.</p>

            <p>This is a little piece that I wrote recently to go with my work in a gallery show, I feel it does a pretty good job of summing up the whys and hows of my work, enjoy :)</p>

            <p>Adornment. A compulsion to create the perfect objects to swaddle our naked bodies, drape them in fibers from the earth, anoint them with treasures from all times and places. A desire to touch what is real, and to connect with the other, which is actually ourselves all allong. As we will find.</p>

            <p>Beginning at the beginning, fibers and threads. Arranging them in such a way as to create fabric, thick or thin, to protect from the sun or from the snow. The fibers of plants and animals guide my hands into doing what they must do. To create. Because we are all just human being after all. After we strip away the antiseptic bubbles that we have placed ourselves in we are our ancestors, longing for the rituals of life, birth, remembering and death. For these things we wear objects to help us remember.</p>

       <p>And the season is over.  The sun returns, now less intense, and the light is a full yellow instead of the brilliant white of the perfectly vertical orb.  The plants give it their best; the food is gathered and eaten.</p>

       <p>The green wanes.<br>
       The winter comes.<br>
       The dry returns.</p>

          <h1>Raindance</h1>
          <p>A thousand tribulations until the waterfalls come forward and give us a proper chance.  We eat fireflies for dinner sometimes to keep the spark and the corner of our mouths clean.  We dip and dive asunder underneath a travelers moon; hunting the illustrious mushroom and wondering after the sandwiches of yore.</p>

          <p>This is our lot, here, in the desert.</p>

<pre>
raindance. 

the sky. upward gaze. 
neck soar from staring at the screen. 
eyes week to bright light. 
can't really enjoy the blue. 

the sky. 
bringer of rain. 
mistress of clouds. 
imagination of gods. 
the lair of the imortal. 
the bain of iccarus. 

we live and die by her tears. 
the tears of joy are better
than those of sadness and complacency. 

when the weeds start to wither away. 
you know it's going to be a long summer.

    <h1>Nocturnal Caffeine</h2>
    <p>Wandering the globe looking for rituals to become obsessed with while caffeine pumps through the veins.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t I have a good old fashioned coming of age ceremony and wander the desert for a week while the men dance the nights away vibrating this earth in my honor? Instead I&#39;ve got an Ipod chock full of turn table riffs and a Yashica medium format camera and a pencil and paper.  Nice paper, top shelf: 100% rag cotton from age old paper mills like Rives and Fabriano.  The pencil is typical duo: mechanical, 2h and 2b.  Oh, right, there&#39;s water color and  a good sable brush.  1 brush cause it&#39;s all about simplification. </p>

<p>My coming of age ritual is obsession with repetition.  I would have been the one that kept walking for a few too many weeks just to keep repeating the good ole one foot in front of the other schtick. </p>

<p>If I drink a coffee at 6pm I&#39;m good till 3am.  I don&#39;t do that much any more mind you, but, rocket fuel when pressed. (Nocturnal Caffeine.) </p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the point (you ask, reading, pondering why).</p><p>We&#39;ve got a time piece--the moon--arguably our most valuable time piece (ocean tides, et al).  I&#39;m gonna go so far as to say the moon is really about all you need to tell time cause: someone else always knows what day it is when you are in a situation which requires one to know the day.</p>

<p>Time moves forward with sickening consistency, a mathematical sterile bliss in which we know the day the moon could have fallen into the earth, had the sun not eaten us (earth) first.  I wonder if the ancients knew the sun would eat us? </p>

<p>Then there is coffee and coffee buys us more time. </p><p>Coffee is such an easy thing to fetishize.  It&#39;s low hanging fruit on the gamut of things to become obsessed with and just begs to be surrounded by ritual.  Instead of the harvest moon ceremony we&#39;ve got the parcel courier bringing the next coffee machine to out door step.  We&#39;ve got exotic beans, a rainbow of roasts, filtered water, organic heirloom cotton filters.  We&#39;ve got timers and temperature probes.  We all make our own daily ritual out of this black water.  We all find solace in the smell, we all get up the courage to go fourth into the sun and accomplish the tasks laid before us.  </p><p>And that&#39;s the point, the ritual which gives us strength to face the terror of time.  So we aren&#39;t that far from the ancients, we are just loners where as they were communal.</p><p>My good friend has his morning process - french press, fresh ground, boil water, 3 minutes steep, push it down, pour it off, enjoy.  Every day.  Perfect.  It&#39;s an offering to the new dawn, a response to the reclaimed conscious of the awakened state a farewell toast to the dream state and it don&#39;t hurt that it gets you high.</p><p>Me: I&#39;m pushing the Aeropress these days.  I roast my own beans, grind them in a fancy Japanese ceramic grinder moments before i scoop them with the designated coffee scoop.  Heat water to 175 degrees cause boiling water burns the coffee and brings forward that acidic beast which starbucks peddles.  Stir - three times clockwise, always clockwise (thanks Tibet) let steep for 90 seconds with a 30 second press.  Immediately clean the Aeropress and put away, turn around, grab my cup and feel the heart race.  </p>
